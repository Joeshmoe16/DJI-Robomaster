# DJI-Robomaster
I created a few fun and unique demos for the DJI Robomaster EP Core. One demo responds to voice commands. One Demo allows the robot to follow you around. One demo allows the robot to run a limited number of Gcode commands. There also is a lot of dance functionality built into the robot. I used rolaty free music from pixabay.com for these dances. The bee dance allows the robot to dance as a bee would in nature. You do have to install the robomaster SDK to use these demos as well as python 3.7.8. Some of the visualizers for the gcode use the pygame library and a matplot library. The voice recognizer uses a library called vosk. You will have to install that library and also download a model from the vosk website. You can see this demo at https://youtu.be/TVp5c3yAMNI. I am fairly new to python and github and am a begining computer enigneering student. I would love to see this code improved, it is definitly beginer code.
