# DJI-Robomaster
I create a few fun and unique demos for the DJI Robomaster EP Core. One demo responds to voice commands. One Demo allows the robot to follow you around. One demo allows the robot to run a limited number of Gcode commands. There also is a lot of dance functionality built into the robot. I used rolaty free music from pixabay.com for these dances. The bee dance allows the robot to dance as a bee would in nature.
